- ``packaging`` is used instead of ``pkginfo`` for parsing and validating
  metadata. This aligns metadata validation to the one performed by PyPI.
  ``packaging`` version 24.0 or later is required. Support for metadata
  version 2.4 requires ``packaging`` 24.2 or later. ``pkginfo`` is not a
  dependency anymore.
- With ``packaging`` version 24.2 or later, metadata fields added with
  metadata version 2.4 as defined by PEP 639 are now sent to the package index
  when a distribution is uploaded. This results in licensing information to
  appear correctly on the package page on PyPI when uploading packages using
  metadata version 2.4.
